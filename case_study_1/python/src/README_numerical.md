## Bayesian analyses with case 1 
Growth and growth-death model
In each case the initial condition is fitted assuming a gaussian prior 
centered around the observed initial condition.

### analyses
- growth model with uniform distribution for growth rates.
- growth-death model with uniform distribution for growth rates and death rates
- growth model with normal distribution (0.5,0.3) for growth rates.
- growth-death model with normal distribution (0.5,0.3) for growth rates and death rates.

### Experimental (Raunak):
- integrating jax
